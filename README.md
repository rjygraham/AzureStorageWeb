# AzureStorageWeb

This is a File -> New Project of an ASP.NET MVC web app and provides capabilities to create, list, and read blobs within an Azure Storage account.

## Usage

For local development/testing, you can use Storage Account Emulator or an Azure Storage Account. For Storage Emulator, change the constructor initializing `BlobServiceClient` on line 16 of `HomeController` to `"UseDevelopmentStorage=true"`.

Otherwise, for using an actual Azure Storage Account, replace the `<storageaccount>` on line 16 of `HomeController` and assign the `Storage Blob Contributor` role assignment to the appopriate identity:

- Local: Assign your user account `Storage Blob Contributor` role assignment on the Storage account and then follow these instructions for enabling Visual Studio to authenticate the application using your credentials: [Authenticating via Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#authenticating-via-visual-studio)
- Azure: Enable system or user assigned managed identity on your App Service and assign that identity  `Storage Blob Contributor` role assignment on the Storage account.
